# BLIND-SEPARATION-OF-SPEECH-SIGNAL
This is fixed-point frequency domain ICA algorithm for the separation of convolutive mixture of speech. The proposed algorithms is based on statistical modeling of time-series of speech spectral components by exponential power distribution and its application in the fixed-point algorithm proposed by Aapo Hyvarinen. This GUI can be used to capture speech signal with two element linear microphone array for separation by fixed-point frequency domain ICA"
